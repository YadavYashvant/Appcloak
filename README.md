Generate WebView-based Android apps from website URLs with customizable names and icons removing distractions like address bar using Jetpack Compose.

❗ This project is in its early stages and is not yet ready for production use. Please check back later for updates. <br>

⚠️ As of now, many websites may not work properly in the WebView. This is due to the fact that many websites are designed to be used in a browser and may not function correctly in a WebView. This is not a limitation of this project, but rather a limitation of the websites themselves.
